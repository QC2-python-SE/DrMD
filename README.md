## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

-> Who is the target user (delia has notes from the meeting)

*(do python files also have the ```file.py``` font given to them?..)*

This project is designed to introduce students to performing quantum circuits on Python. This package allows users to play around with applying different quantum operators onto two-qubit states and perform a measurement in the Z-basis at the end of a circuit.

Users may utilize the ```UnitaryGate``` class found in unitary_gate.py to construct gates in their quantum circuit and perform a variety of operations associated to unitary operators. Users can either select from pre-existing gates listed in gate_list.py, which covers essential gates like the Pauli matrices, as well as the Hadamard and CNOT gates. Of course, users are also permitted to and encouraged to experiment with their own unitary gates they construct using the ```UnitaryGate``` class. Gates may be only be constructed from 4x4 unitary matrices, or from two 2x2 matrices, whatever may suit their fancy. The class is constructed such that an informative error will be printed should they try to construct a gate from a non-unitary operator, or perhaps a frog. The class also contains the ```apply``` function that takes a gate and applies it to either a four element ```ndarray``` or an object from the ```QubitState``` class. *(idk what the ```repr``` or ```copy``` function really does sorry)*. The ``dagger`` function returns the Hermitian conjugate of a unitary operator, a crucial feature as the Hermitian conjugate of unitaries are their own inverse. The ```compare``` function allows users to compare if two gates are equal, allowing users to becoming familiar with important relationships in quantum circuits, such as the relationships between Pauli matrices or how the X gate is equivalent to applying a Hadamard, Z, then Hadamard gates on a qubit. The ```random_unitary``` function also allows users to toy with random circuits.

The aforementioned ```QubitState``` class in qubit_state.py allows users to define qubit states as objects, as opposed to ndarrays. Users are, as before, given errors before constructing qubit states of the incorrect shape or type (our package only permits two qubit circuits, so either a single 4x1 array or two 2x1 arrays corresponding to each qubit!). The ```peek``` function allows users to get an informative understanding of the qubit state in the computational basis at any point of the circuit to ensure the circuit works as expected at every point. Two avenues of measurement are also offered by this package. The ```measure_stats``` function gives an in-depth review of the qubits post-measurement, detailing all the possible states the measurement projects to and their associated probabilities. The ```measure_collapse``` function merely outputs one such state with a given probability, so toy around and run your circuit over and over and witness the probabilistic nature of quantum circuits for yourself!

*(I don't understand half of the functions in QubitState to be honest)*
